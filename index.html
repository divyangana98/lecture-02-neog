    Hi ! I am Divyangana.
    <p>Some of my fav quotes...</p>
   <p>"We take the gravel and the shell and we make a pearl."</p>

  <p>"What matters the most is that you have an open heart and an open heart connects and understands."</p>
  <p>This is lecture 02 of levelZero NeogCamp.</p>

  <p>I have worked on a few CLI apps. I'll showcase it in my portfolio website soon.</p>
  <p>My favourite movie currently is Hotel Transylvania. It's funny and cute. Papa Drac is obviously my favourite character. If you wanna lift up your mood, I recommend you watch this movie.</p>
    <p>I like doodling, dancing and watching  movies.</p>
